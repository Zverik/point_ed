# GeoJSON Point Editor

This is a dedicated editor for points in a GeoJSON. Lines are not supported, but preserved.
Structured properties and properties with keys starting with `$` are hidden and preserved.

## Why is it better?

- Few controls: no menus or button rows to distract.
- Points are editable on click, no extra "edit" buttons.
- See point name in a tooltip, no clicking needed.
- Edit properties as text: copy and paste, add multiple keys without navigating a table control.
- One-click exporting to GeoJSON.
- Filter points by keys and values, export filtered points.
